Understanding how we are able to perform such a diverse set of complex tasks has
been a central question for the Artificial Intelligence community. We
hypothesise that the key to solving such tasks lies more in finding a set of
sub-tasks that can easily span the set of all possible tasks, rather than
finding the best sub-tasks for the goal. We model this hypothesis using the
framework of reinforcement learning, and define the sub-tasks based on
Kleinberg's small world model. Our preliminary results suggest that this
hypothesis may indeed be valid. Further experimentation needs to be done to say
so more confidently.
